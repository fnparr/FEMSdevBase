Description: 
    FEMSdevBase is similar in functional content to FEMSdevPkg except that it 
    not include any shiny applications within this. This means that FEMSdevBase
    can be imported into a shiny app which is then deployed to the Shiny.io 
    cloud. 
    The principle exported functions are: 
    samplePortfolio( ) which reads designated csv files 
    with Bond portfolio and risk factor data, then creates and returns a 
    Portfolio object with this contents.  A Portfolio contains all necessary
    information to request an ACTUS server cashflow event generation for its
    contracts using the designated scenario i.e. list of Risk factors. The 
    exported function generateEvents(<portfolio>, <ACTUS-serverURL>)  calls out
    to an ACTUS server to simulate the contracts of the portfolio using the risk
    factors in the portfoilio as context getting back a list of cashFlow event 
    one for each contract. The exported function EventSeries(<Contract>, 
    <risk-factor-list>, <ACTUS-serverURL> takes as input (1) a single ACTUS 
    contract, (2) a list of risk factors and an ACTUS server url. It generates 
    a portfolio containing this single contract then calls generateEvents( ) to
    have the designated ACTUS server simulate the contract cashflow events. The
    EventSeries saves the cashflow events of the input contract as a datafram 
    together with the contractID and its contract type. Exported function 
    cashflowPlot(<EventSerie>) generates a detailed graphical display of the 
    events in the input EventSeries. Exported utility function 
    installSampleData(<mydirectory>) copies samplecsv files with contract 
    definitions and risk factor date into a sesignated user directory as a model 
    for how to add data to be processed by these functions.
