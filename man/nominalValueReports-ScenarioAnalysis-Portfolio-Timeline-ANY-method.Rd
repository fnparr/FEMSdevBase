\description{
nominalValueReports(host= ScenarioAnalysis, ptf=Portfolio, tl- Timeline) 
creates a list of NV reports using the eventsByPeriod data in the host 
ScenarioAnalysis. Inputs ptf and tl are used in this process. The nominal
Value reports are saved in host$nominalValueReports.
Each NV report is a vector of numeric values - one for statusDate and a 
value for each reportDate, so host$nominalValueReports is a list of 
list(cid,nominalValueVector) elements. 
The method returns a log msg - no known causes for error
}
\details{
Method nominalValueReports(host) uses host$cashflowEventsByPeriod dataframe
for input data except for the statusDate value for each contract which comes 
from the ptf input parameter and the tl timeline parameter to understand 
the number and dates of reports .

************
We get nominalValue at each reportDate for a specific contract as follows: 
Step(1): subset the scna$cashflowEventsByPeriod dataframe to rows with this
cid and periodIndex == a report period i.e. periodIndex <= reportCount. 
Step(2): subset this dataframe to the columns: periodIndex and nominalValue.
Step(3): subset further: for each period make a list of eventrow indexes for
that period; keep the last-event-in-period, discard the others. Since the 
nominalValue of the contract cannot change after the last event,
the reported nominalValue at the time of this last event is the correct value
to report for the period. 
Step(4): convert dataframe nominalValues to a report vector with na for 
report periods in which there was no event generating nominalValue status
Step(5): add StatusDate nominalPrincipal from contractTerms as first 0th element
Step(6): use library(zoo) na.locf() to forward fill missing (na) values in 
the nominalValueReport vector with "the most recent" value from left. Since
there was no intervening event to change nominalValue this is still correct.

The list of nominalValueReports for all contracts in the contractsAnalysis
is by reapplying the single contract algorithm to the events dataframe for
each unique cid in the events dataframe
