\description{
This method is used to start a cashflow analysis of contract holdings of 
  an enterprise. The user supplies information specifying the analysis to 
  be performed. The method is a constructor returning an initialized
  S4 ContractAnalysis object which is then used to step through the analysis
  process saving results at each step. The completed analysis will provide 
  projected liquidity change, income and valuation for each held contract 
  at a set of specified report periods for a specified risk scenario. The
  risk scenario is defined as a list of projected market interest and 
  possibly stock price movements over time. Contract cashflow behavior is 
  simulated by calling out to an identified ACTUS server.  Input Yield curve
  data is used to set discounting and risk free growth factors used to 
  determine a projected contract value at each defined future report time for
  each contract in the enterprise portfolio. 
  
  Steps in the ContractAnalysis are: (1) Initialization (2) Portfolio 
  simulation generating projected cashflow behavior for each contract 
  (3) Bucket the cashevents for each contract to enable reporting for each
  period in the timeline (4) Compute contract income for each report period 
  based in non principal flows for each contract (5) Compute contract 
  liquidity for each report period based on all period cashflows for each
  (6) compute NetPresentValue for each contract at the start time and at each
  report point using aggregated bucket flows for the contract and a 
  correction for residual cashflow project to occur beyond the bucket horizon
  - applying discounting and growth factors derived from the supplied Yield 
  Curve Data (7) Computing some key ratios for the Enterprise based on these 
  results
